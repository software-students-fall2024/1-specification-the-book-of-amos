## Stakeholders

Stakeholder 1: Caryn, S. -- Advanced level baker/cook who used to run an online bakery business through Instagram.

    Goals:
        1. Find recipes based on what they already (mostly) have in the fridge.
        2. Concise communication of recipe -- instructions and notes clearly represented with little bloat
        3. Focused on pictures and videos. Want to *see* what friends made and/or shared, not simply read it.
        4. Create folders to group recipes, in case they want to prepare for a multi-course meal.
        5. Be able to link account to other social media.
        6. Convert older handwritten recipes to digital without having to type it all by hand.

    Frustrations:
        1. Recipes only having volume measurements (cups, tablespoons, etc), but not mass measurements.
        2. Paragraphs of backstory with recipe at the very end.
        3. Lacking search features. Said that it can be tricky to find a recipe based on characteristics (flavor profile, country of origin, etc). Often times need to already have a dish in mind.
        4. Other social media sites aren't formatted for easily reading or writing out recipes, often times resigned to writing them out in the description box of a picture or video post which is not ideal.

Stakeholder 2: Lilly, S. -- Beginner level baker/cook

    Goals:
        1. Want to see what friends are cooking/creating. More interested in a 'following' tab than a 'for you' tab.
        2. Be able to compliment in comment on friends recipes/posts.
        3. Create folders for different recipes.
        4. Ask for suggestions from friends on what could be improved in a recipe.

    Frustrations:
        1. Recipe sites that lead with several paragraphs of back story before getting to the recipe.
        2a. Recipes not being up-front about more specialized equipment (stand mixer, blender, etc)
        2b. Not being able to search by required equipment.
        3. Ads make many dedicated recipe websites actively aggravating to use. Overall experience is cluttered and clunky.
        4. Difficult to get a sense of what a recipe may cost until she's already at the grocery store checkout.
